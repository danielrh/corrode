This is the main driver-program entry point for Corrode.

It brings together the C parser and preprocessor interface from
[language-c](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-c), Corrode's
algorithms, and the pretty-printing library
[pretty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty), all while
reporting errors in a consistent way.

```haskell
import Control.Monad.Trans.Class
import Control.Monad.Trans.Except
import Data.List
import Language.C
import Language.C.System.GCC
import Language.C.System.Preprocess
import Language.Rust.Corrode.C
import Language.Rust.Idiomatic
import System.Environment
import System.Exit
import System.FilePath
import Text.PrettyPrint.HughesPJClass
```

There are lots of steps in this process, and several of them return an
`Either`, which is used similarly to Rust's `Result` type. In Haskell we
don't have the `try!` macro that Rust has; instead the `ExceptT` monad
encapsulates the "return early on failure" pattern.

We layer `ExceptT` on top of the `IO` monad so that we're permitted to
access files and command-line arguments, but we need to adapt various
types of return values from different functions we'll call. For a
function which performs pure computation and might fail, wrap the
function call in `try`. If the function can also do I/O, wrap it in
`tryIO` instead.

```haskell
try :: Either e a -> ExceptT e IO a
try = tryIO . return

tryIO :: IO (Either e a) -> ExceptT e IO a
tryIO = ExceptT
```

We use one other function for dealing with errors. `withExceptT f`
applies `f` to the error value, if there is one, which lets us convert
different types of errors to one common error type.

Here's the pipeline:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = dieOnError $ do
```

1. Use language-c to extract the command-line arguments we care about.
   We'll pass the rest to the preprocessor.

    ```haskell
        let cc = newGCC "gcc"
        options <- lift getArgs
        (rawArgs, _other) <- try (parseCPPArgs cc options)
    ```

1. The user may have specified the `-o <outputfile>` option. Not only do
   we ignore that, but we need to suppress it so the preprocessor
   doesn't write its output where a binary was expected to be written.
   We also force-undefine preprocessor symbols that would indicate
   support for language features we can't actually handle, and remove
   optimization flags that make GCC define preprocessor symbols.

    ```haskell
        let defines = [Define "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" "0", Define "__NO_CTYPE" "1"]
        let undefines = map Undefine ["__BLOCKS__", "__FILE__", "__LINE__"]
        let warnings = ["-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined"]
        let args = foldl addCppOption
                (rawArgs
                    { outputFile = Nothing
                    , extraOptions = filter (not . ("-O" `isPrefixOf`)) (extraOptions rawArgs)
                    })
                (map Undefine ["__BLOCKS__", "__FILE__", "__LINE__"])
    ```

1. Run the preprocessor&mdash;except that if the input appears to have
   already been preprocessed, then we should just read it as-is.

    ```haskell
        input <- if isPreprocessed (inputFile args)
            then lift (readInputStream (inputFile args))
            else withExceptT
                (\ status -> "Preprocessor failed with status " ++ show status)
                (tryIO (runPreprocessor cc args))
    ```

1. Get language-c to parse the preprocessed source to a `CTranslUnit`.

    ```haskell
        unit <- withExceptT show (try (parseC input (initPos (inputFile args))))
    ```

1. Generate a list of Rust items from this C translation unit.

    ```haskell
        items <- try (interpretTranslationUnit unit)
    ```

1. Pretty-print all the items as a `String`.

    ```haskell
        let output = intercalate "\n"
                [ prettyShow (itemIdioms item) ++ "\n"
                | item <- items
                ]
    ```

1. Write the final string to a file with the same name as the input,
   except with any extension replaced by ".rs".

    ```haskell
        let rsfile = replaceExtension (inputFile args) ".rs"
        lift $ do
            writeFile rsfile output
            putStrLn rsfile
            putStrLn $ case outputFile rawArgs of
                Just outfile -> outfile
                Nothing -> replaceExtension (inputFile args) ".o"
    ```

When the pipeline ends, we need to check whether it resulted in an
error. If so, we call `die` to print the error message to `stderr` and
exit with a failure status code.

```haskell
dieOnError :: ExceptT String IO a -> IO a
dieOnError m = do
    result <- runExceptT m
    case result of
        Left err -> die err
        Right a -> return a
```
